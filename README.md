# seayatl

seayatl (pronounced "Seattle") is more than a project. It's a lifestyle, an idea, a revolution. No human would ever have had the idea to write a tui library in C -- until seayatl. Enter the sea and ride on the waves to a great TUI.

## Etymology
_yatl_ means _yet another tui library_, whereas _sea_ is both a pun on `C` and an image of freedom and opportunity. Joined together they form _seayatl_, yet another pun on a US city.
